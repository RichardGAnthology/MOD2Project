# Hello all! This is the final project for second MOD of the program. 

**My cohort and I were assigned tasks such that:**

1. The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible.
2. It should use the create-react-app generator to start the project. 
3. It makes use of React Router (install react-router-dom).
4. It should incorporate 2 container components.
5. It should incorporate 5 stateless components.
6. There should be 3 or more routes.
7. The client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation.
8. It uses CSS to style the application.
9. The frontend uses AJAX (fetch) requests.
10. The application has at least 2 unique APIs (should be related in some way).
11. The readme file clearly documents the purpose of the project as a problem statement.
12. The readme file clearly documents the target end user for this project.

# The space below will be dedicated to the aforementioned final two points.  

## The purpose of this project.

The purpose of this project is a simple one which makes it all the better. In it's final version, tt is meant to facilitate the lives of any and all whom find themselves using it. It is a program that will inform it's users of the weather, global news, and relevant stock information, whether it be prices or news, depending on what the user inputs. Ideally, as I have envisioned it, it will be primarily used in the early hours and late hours of the day. To set a scene: you wake up, open the program and within seconds have enough information to decide whether you will call out of work or not...I joke. But, you will have enough information to decide whether or not you change your position on an investment you've made, or whether you should start a new position. Personally, I created this app with the real intention of using it when finished and polished. The absence of advertisement alone is a great motivator, but the colors also help. 

## The target end user for this project. 

It's easy to say that I've answered this question already, but I don't feel like I have... and I say this because I don't believe this program is for everyone. It is meant to be used by those that find themselves interested in any fluctuations of their investments, those that would like to stay up to date on news involving their investments and more importantly, whether or not they should take an umbrella if they don't call out of work...is this joke getting old? In other words, the end user for this project is the person that has to open three apps to find information that only they will care about but instead finds themselves getting bombarded with advertisement because they googled vacuums before heading to bed the night before. 

**Enjoy!**
